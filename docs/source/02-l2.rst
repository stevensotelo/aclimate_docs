Level 2: Container
==================

Container Diagrams focus on the major software systems within the system boundary identified 
in the System Context Diagram. Containers represent executable software applications, 
such as web applications, mobile apps, or databases, that reside within the system. 
This level provides an overview of the different types of containers, their responsibilities, 
and the relationships between them. Container Diagrams help stakeholders understand 
the high-level structure of the system and the key components that make up the architecture.
