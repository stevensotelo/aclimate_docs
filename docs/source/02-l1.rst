Level 1: System Context
=======================

At the highest level, the System Context Diagram depicts the system as a 
single box surrounded by its external entities, such as users, systems, and external dependencies. 
This diagram provides a broad view of the system and its interactions with the outside world. 
It helps stakeholders understand how the system fits into its larger environment, 
the external actors it interacts with, and the boundaries of the system.

The AClimate platform serves as a comprehensive solution to support decision making process, 
catering to the needs of researchers, decision-makers, farmers, and extension agents. 
Researchers are people who analyze and configure data into the system, while decision-makers rely on its insights to 
make informed choices. Farmers benefit from information and recommendations for agricultural practices, 
and extension agents facilitate effective communication and support.
