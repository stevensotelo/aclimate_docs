Level 1: System Context
=======================

At the highest level, the System Context Diagram depicts the system as a 
single box surrounded by its external entities, such as users, systems, and external dependencies. 
This diagram provides a broad view of the system and its interactions with the outside world. 
It helps stakeholders understand how the system fits into its larger environment, 
the external actors it interacts with, and the boundaries of the system.

L1: Users
---------
The platform serves as a comprehensive solution to support decision making process, 
catering to the needs of researchers, decision-makers, farmers, and extension agents. 
Researchers are people who analyze and configure data into the system, while decision-makers rely on its insights to 
make informed choices. Farmers benefit from information and recommendations for agricultural practices, 
and extension agents facilitate effective communication and support. 

L1: AClimate system
-------------------
AClimate system serves as a vital component, providing valuable insights and predictions. 
This system acts as a central hub that generates forecasts directly into the platform. 
It establishes connections to obtain relevant data from diverse sources, ensuring the 
availability of accurate and up-to-date information. Leveraging additional applications and tools, 
the system employs advanced algorithms and models to generate forecasts specific to agroclimatic conditions. 
Furthermore, it incorporates crop simulation techniques to simulate the growth and development of 
crops under different climatic scenarios. By integrating these capabilities.

L1: Melisa
----------
Melisa Chatbot is an innovative chatbot system designed to provide agroclimatic information using 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques across various social media and messaging platforms.
