Level 3: Component
==================

Component Diagrams dive deeper into each container identified in the previous level. 
They depict the internal components and their interactions within a specific container. 
Components represent the key building blocks or modules within a container, such as classes, 
modules, or services. These diagrams provide a more detailed view of the internal structure 
of each container and help stakeholders understand how the components collaborate to fulfill 
the system's functionality.
