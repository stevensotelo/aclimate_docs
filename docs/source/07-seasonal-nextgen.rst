NextGen
=======

NextGen is an approach to produce weather
and climate forecasts at timescales of weeks
to years. It’s based on more than 25 years of
research at Columbia University’s Internation-
al Research Institute for Climate and Society,
and is being implemented in countries across
the world through the Columbia World Project
“Adapting Agriculture to Climate Today for
Tomorrow” (ACToday)
