Layers
###########

To search and view the different layers, on the home page you can click on the left area, on layer preview data.

  :class: device-screen-vertical side-by-side

Once here, all the layers will be listed for viewing. You can filter in the search bar (where there is a magnifying glass) either by name of the workspace, example aclimate_et or by name or title of the layer.

**Click for** `search a layer <https://geo.aclimate.org/geoserver/web/wicket/bookmarkable/org.geoserver.web.demo.MapPreviewPage?1&filter=false>`_

The following keywords are relevant to layer search:

- crop (e.g. maize, coffee, etc) 
- group (e.g. dry_spells, heat_waves, spei, etc) 
- units (e.g. days, mm, etc) 
- season (e.g. seasonal, subseasonal) 
- scenario (e.g. above, normal, below)
- country iso (e.g. et, gt, ao, pe)
- workspaces (e.g. aclimate_et, aclimate_gt, agroclimate_indices_ao, climate_extreme_indices_et, climate_indices_pe)

Once you have searched for the layer of interest, clicking on OpenLayers will open a new page displaying the layer:

.. image:: /_static/img/09-geoserver/geoserver-layer-visualization.*

If you want to change the **time** parameter of the layer to display it on different dates, you can do it by adding the follows:

.. image:: /_static/img/09-geoserver/geoserver-layer-visualization-time.*
  :alt: GeoServer layer preview OpenLayers
  :class: device-screen-vertical side-by-side

Please note that the date format is YYYY-MM. For the subseasonal layers the same format is followed, but MM represents the week. That is to say from 1-4
