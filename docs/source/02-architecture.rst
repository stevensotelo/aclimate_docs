Architecture
============

Welcome to the documentation for the architecture of the AClimate platform. 
In this document, we will explore the fundamental concepts of software architecture 
and explain how we have adopted The C4 Model for Software Architecture `(Brown, 2018)`, 
to describe the structure and organization of our platform.

Architecture, in the context of software development, refers to the high-level design and 
organization of a system. It provides a blueprint that outlines the components, 
their interactions, and the overall structure of a software application. 
Just as a building architect designs a structure to meet specific requirements, 
a software architect designs the software system to fulfill the needs of 
its users while considering factors such as scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

The C4 Model for Software Architecture, provides a hierarchical 
approach to visualizing software architecture. It consists of four levels, 
each serving a specific purpose in describing the system's structure and interactions.
The four level contains too much detailed that is out of our goal in this documentation. 
By this reason we won't reach that level.
