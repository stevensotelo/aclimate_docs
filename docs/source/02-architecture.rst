Architecture
============

The architecture describes how the platform was built. It contains a description
of whole components of the solution in different scales and points of view.

This section follows the guidelines of the C4 model to define 
the architecture of the systems at different levels `(Brown, 2018)`.
The Level 1 describes the system context
